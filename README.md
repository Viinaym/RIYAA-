# riyAA â€“ My Personal AI Assistant  
**(R.I.Y.A.A. â€“ Robotic Intelligence and Yielded Artificial Assistance)**

RIYAA is a project Iâ€™ve started to build my own AI assistant â€” like a small version of ChatGPT, but made by me.  
Itâ€™s a computer-based assistant that can talk, reply, and maybe even do some smart tasks later.

Right now, Iâ€™m just learning and building the basics â€” like how to make it respond properly, remember things, and slowly get better.

Iâ€™m also learning Arduino on the side, but for now, RIYAA is only focused on the software part. I might combine both in the future if needed.

Iâ€™m doing this to improve my coding, build something cool, and learn step by step. Still a long way to go, but Iâ€™ve started.

### ðŸ’» Tools I'm Using:
- Python
- Simple file memory (for now)
- Some basic AI/NLP stuff

---

### ðŸ“Œ Goals:
- Build something of my own from scratch  
- Learn how AI assistants work  
- Try to mix it with my ideas in future

This project is under progress â€” Iâ€™m learning and building at the same time.
